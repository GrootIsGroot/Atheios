     So I've been getting asked this question a lot recently, "What is joules?",
Joules is a self sustainable smart contract. Joules works by paying dividends
   out to it's stake holders. When you Deposit Atheios to the contract you are
  issued joules(stake). Overtime you will be issued dividends you can either 
  claim or reinvest your earnings. If you claim your dividends the ATH 
  will be sent to your address. But if you reinvest your dividends you will 
  will recieve more joules(stake) which will yield to a higher dividends payout.
  The fees keep allow for dividends payouts to be sustainable**
  
  There's a safe math library imported into the contract to keep it secure from
  exploits.
 - Calculations:
 - Deposit fee: Amount/(100/7) = deposit fee
 - Withdrawal fee: Amount/(100/4) = withdrawal fee
 - Stake Calculation: stakeValue + ((100/7)/totalstake)
 - TotalStake is calculated by: totalstake issued + Stake increment 
   
   So you ask yourself why would participate in Joules? Joules gives you the 
   opportunity to grow your investment by reinvesting your dividends that recieve
   (which increases your overall stake)= higher dividend payouts
   or you could look at it as passive income where you'd just claim your dividends
   and do what you wish with them. 
   Overall I look Joules as a way for people to have fun, if you're like me and
   don't have a lot ATH you can start small and let it grow. The possiblities are 
   end less.
